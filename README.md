Hello there!

-  Hi, I’m Mladen @mladenk90
-  I’m interested in starting a career in programming and actively learning new languages.
-  I’m currently learning CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. I have completed CS50x and CS50w from HarvardX and plan on learning more.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I want to learn as much as possible about programming and eventually start contributing to the world of programming.
-  I am an older new guy when it comes to this stuff, but I am very ambitous about learning and applying as much as I can. Just looking for a chance to prove someone right!
